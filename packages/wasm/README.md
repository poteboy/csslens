# Emox

**ðŸš§ This project is under active development and not yet ready for use. ðŸš§**

Emox is a Visual Studio Code extension that enhances your coding experience by displaying the actual CSS rules inline within your JavaScript and TypeScript files. This extension is particularly useful when working with CSS Modules but wanting to have a Developer eXperience similar to CSS-in-JS, providing immediate visibility of the applied styles without back-and-forth between the CSS and JavaScript files.
